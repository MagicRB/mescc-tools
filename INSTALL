Building and Installing mescc-tools

* Get it
	git clone https://github.com/oriansj/mescc-tools.git

* Prerequisites
** Bootstrapping
mescc-tools can be bootstrapped from a simple hex assembler.
Once hex0 (in test1) is built, you'll be able to build hex1
exec_enable (test6) will also need to be built on systems that require an execute
bit to be set on binaries before they can be run.
Once hex1 is built, hex2-linker can be built with it.
Once hex2-linker is built, M1-Macro can be built with it.
Then everything else can be built with M1-Macro and hex2

** Development
The tools required for easier development include binutils, gcc and make

* Build it
	make
or
	./build.sh

* Check it
	make test
or
	./check.sh

* Install it
	make install
or
	./install.sh
