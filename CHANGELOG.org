* Current
** Added
created test2 (a 32bit x86 hex assembler) with its associated build and test changes
Fixed proof answers for test1 and test2
Added support to M0 for multiple architectures
Added range checking into M0 to make sure immediates will fit into specified space
Added a basic tutorial for generating new M0 definitions
Created a M1 compatible version of test0
Added an amd64 program for enabling execute bits (might need to later alter the 0777)
Added an i386 program for enabling execute bits (might need to later alter the 0777)

** Changed
Adjusted tags to reflect current CHANGELOG
Make test now depends upon test2 completing
Changed how M0 processes input to reduce stack usage and improve performance
Renamed M0 to M1 to reflect the additional functionality it provides
Applied Janneke's patch for accepting hex numerics in M1
Refactored x86/amd64 elf headers to a standard to avoid duplication

** Fixed
Removed unrequired temp file in test1
Clarified meaning of Label>base displacement conditional
Corrected error in test0 elf32
Test1 and Test2 to reflect the fact that /bin/bash doesn't exist in guix
Fixed M0 regression to continue to support original test code
Corrected makefile and build scripts to reflect rename
Modified test make scripts to reflect new standard elf headers
Fixed base address needed by test5 and its associated checksum

** Removed

Removed alerting on missing files in cleanup target
Removed massive M0 Definition lists as they don't serve a useful purpose

* 0.1 - 2017-6-25
** Added

Incorporated support for multiple input files in M0
Added support for little Endian immediate output in M0
Added Hex assembler example test
Added support for Label>base in Hex2
Added Version info
Added install target
Added inital guix package definition

** Changed
Displacement calculations are now based on architecture specific rules
