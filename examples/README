This folder contains only example versions of C programs implementing the Hex1,
Hex2 and M1-Macro specifications; although only the marginal subset that was
ultimately needed to bootstrap mescc-tools on that specific architecture.

Considerable modification maybe required should you wish to use them for your
architecture's bootstrap and thus are more informational than anything else.

They are neither examples of clean code nor best practices for bootstrapping.
